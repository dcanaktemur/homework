# Hangman Server Task

OpenAPI 3.0 description file. Describes the API exposed to the end users.

Aim of the testtask is to implement the server logic from the API description. It is preferable that all endpoints are 
implemented, though we are considerate on the time constraints.

Languages and frameworks can be freely chosen, though we would recommend the implementation in more widespread toolkits.
We would expect that the code can be compiled and runs after that from command line without significant effort.
